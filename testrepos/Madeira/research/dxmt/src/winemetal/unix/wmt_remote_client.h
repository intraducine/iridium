/* ml762: remote winemetal backend -- route unixcalls to a host Metal daemon.
 *
 * In remote mode winemetal creates NO local Metal objects. Every obj_handle_t
 * in the process is therefore a tagged remote handle, and the tag is what makes
 * a partial switch detectable: a local pointer reaching the wire, or a remote
 * id reaching a local Metal call, is a named error at the point of misuse
 * rather than a subtly wrong frame on another machine.
 *
 * ⚠️ The mode is decided ONCE and never changes. Flipping it mid-process would
 * leave handles from both address spaces alive simultaneously, which is exactly
 * the state the tag exists to make impossible.
 *
 * Calls not yet routed fail BY NAME. Discovering the remaining surface by
 * running is the approach that has worked throughout: the command census found
 * 15 of 38 opcodes, the API census 43 of 127 entries -- both far smaller than
 * the speculative estimate.
